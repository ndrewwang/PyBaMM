        "# Motivation\n",
        "By understanding the principles and architecture behind batteries, we can build up an intuition that will help evaluate and identify future developments in the energy storage space. This curriculum is aimed at all those with a can-do technical attitude and enthusiasm in batteries. It will be particularly handy for analysts, reporters, investors, and students interested in joining Intercalation Station on the full journel of the creation of a simple tool in python. \n",
        "\n",
        "The inception of the tool was motivated by looking for a quick way to guesstimate answer questions such as:\n",
        "- Why can silicon store so much more capacity than graphite?\n",
        "- Why is LFP considered a lower energy material?\n",
        "- Can we fact check this [Quantumscape investor slide](https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-2-740x416.jpg)?\n",
        "- Why is lithium the preferred charge carrier?\n",
        "- Why does Quantumscape's solid electrolyte have be a certain thickness?\n",
        "- How much packaging efficiency is gained in Tesla's new 4680 cell?\n",
        "- Why did JouleCP ask researchers to report volume of electrolyte used?\n",

        "Initial goal will be to explain the mechanics of this [online calculator](http://lacey.se/apps/cell-energy/):  and build our own.\n"

        "The amount of charge held by a battery. Where charge is the amount of current able to be maintained for a certain amount of time: $Q = It$. It typically written in units of mAh, for example your phone has a capacity of approx 3000 mAh. Roughly speaking, that 3000 mAh battery should be able to sustain a 3000 milli-amp (3 amp) current for 1 hour (3600 seconds). A good grasp of units will be useful going forward...\n",

        "Has units of joules (J), the energy of a battery relates to the voltage of the battery: $\\text{Energy} = VQ = VIt$. Voltage (V) multiplied with amps (A) gives power in the units watts (W). When this power is sustained for a certain time by a battery, the energy is given by watt-hours (Wh). Voltage and energy is equally important as capacity. An infinite capacity battery with a cell voltage lower than 3V would not even power your TV remote. \n",

        "#### _Power_\n",

        "We also care about how dense the battery is. This means how much capacity, energy, or power the battery can deliver relative to the size of the battery. Size can be defined either in terms of weight or volume. For example, the weight-relative capacity is sometimes refered to as the specific capacity or gravimetric capacity, and the volume-relative capacity is refered to as the volumetric capacity. \n",
